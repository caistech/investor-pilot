# InvestorPilot — Project Status

Last updated: 2026-05-18 AEST (evening continuation — localisation verified end-to-end; 7-bug cascade fixed; Teams pending accept click)

## Current State

Live on https://investor-pilot-pi.vercel.app/. Forked from PartnerPilot for
F2K Housing Development Fund — sourcing sophisticated/wholesale investors
(s708(8) Corporations Act). Dual-mode: **Projects** (fundraising — investors)
and **Products** (sales — channel partners), both first-class peers with
shared infrastructure and dedicated tone. **Multi-tenant teams** with
per-member channels live as of 2026-05-18.

### What works (operator-facing)

- **Discovery + scoring** — Brave web search + LinkedIn 1st/2nd-degree
  (via Unipile), scored on 5 ICP dimensions, evidence linked back
- **Enrichment** — Hunter.io email finder, LinkedIn profile pull
- **Sequencer** — 6-step LinkedIn + email cadence, tier-modulated tone
  (confident / qualified / exploratory), courtesy contract enforced,
  value-offer DNA, signature handling, render-now concurrency
- **Auto-localisation** — 14 languages (Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese,
  Chinese, Thai, Indonesian, Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish,
  French, German, Italian, Turkish, Russian) at render time, English
  original preserved in evidence_refs, one-click toggle in /approvals
- **Approvals queue** — pending/blocked drafts visible org-wide, tier
  and language badges in card headers, prominent English-version toggle
  for translated drafts
- **Send + track** — Resend for email (verified sender
  `noreply@updates.corporateaisolutions.com`), Unipile for LinkedIn,
  outreach_log + outbound_messages persist message IDs
- **Resend webhook** at `/api/webhooks/resend` — bounce/complaint/
  delivery-delayed handling with svix signature validation (operator
  must configure endpoint URL + signing secret in Resend dashboard
  before this is reachable)
- **Pool Summary** — one-page auto-generated deliverable per project
  and product. Surfaced as headline chips on list rows, featured cards
  on the dashboard, and cross-linked from every partner detail page.
  Print to PDF for sponsor delivery.
- **Compliance** — per-project / per-product compliance rulesets
  (standard + finance_au_senior_debt built-in) block unapproved
  language pre-send
- **Operator controls** — daily caps, warmup curves, per-channel
  kill switch, channels page health monitoring
- **Teams** — owner/admin invites teammates via Supabase Auth
  invite-email (branded "InvestorPilot" via Resend SMTP). Each
  member connects their own LinkedIn + email; sequencer picks the
  right member's channel by step ownership. Shared dataroom
  (templates, products, projects, KB, prospects) across the org.
  `/settings/team` for member + role management. Migration 028
  added `client_channels.user_id` + `sequence_steps.created_by_user_id`,
  backfilled to existing owners so single-user orgs see zero
  behaviour change.
- **Public pages reflect what shipped** — landing, playbook, about,
  pricing all updated 2026-05-18 with Teams, Pool Summary as
  sponsor deliverable, Resend bounce auto-handling, and the 14
  auto-translation languages. Landing + playbook ported from inline
  headers to the shared `<PublicHeader />` / `<PublicFooter />`
  components so easy-claude-code's mobile work applies uniformly.
- **HeyGen dashboard explainer video regenerated** — 60s narration
  covering Projects/Products dual mode, tier modulation +
  auto-translation, Pool Summary deliverable, Teams, human-approved
  send + audit trail. New `HEYGEN_VIDEO_ID`
  (`3dfc15c762484fd7997622d0e9e2fe92`) live on Vercel across all
  three envs. Component's dismiss-key now scoped per video_id so
  regenerated narration shows even to operators who dismissed the
  prior version.
- **Middleware fix — webhooks now actually reachable** —
  `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts` was 401'ing every `/api/*` request
  without a Supabase auth cookie, silently killing both `/api/webhooks/resend`
  and `/api/webhooks/unipile/account` before their own
  signature/secret check could run. Fixed by excluding
  `/api/webhooks/*` from the middleware auth gate; each route still
  self-validates (svix for Resend, shared-secret header for Unipile).
  No security regression. Pre-existing Unipile silent-failure bug
  also resolved by the same one-line fix.
- **HeyGen dashboard video fix** — the regenerated video showed
  HeyGen 404 because `vercel env add` over an `echo` pipe stored the
  HEYGEN_VIDEO_ID with a trailing `\n` (33 bytes not 32). Re-added
  via `printf`, redeployed, video plays. Generator script
  (`scripts/generate-heygen-video.mjs`) now prints the correct
  `printf` invocation at the end of every run so this doesn't recur.

### Architecture

- Next.js 14 on Vercel (corporate-ai-solutions team)
- Supabase (auth + Postgres) — project ref `azelomanmlywwzbpkksy` (Seoul)
- Sequencer renderer in `src/lib/sequencer/render.ts` — shared across
  project + product flows
- Pool Summary aggregation in `src/lib/pool/summary.ts` — shared across
  both kinds; single source of truth for REGION_PATTERNS /
  LANGUAGE_BY_REGION / SECTOR_PATTERNS
- `@caistech/ai-client`, `@caistech/brave-search`,
  `@caistech/hunter-email`, `@caistech/unipile-channels`

### Risk tier: REVENUE

High read:edit discipline. Shared module changes require review of all
consumers. Deployment errors must be resolved before moving to new
features. No "simplest fix" shortcuts — pipeline correctness affects
live email delivery.

## Verify first thing next session

1. ~~Auto-localisation end-to-end~~ **DONE 2026-05-18 evening.** Tra Hoang
   (cron-triggered render) and Ngoc Nam Nguyen (UI Regenerate) both
   produced Vietnamese drafts with `evidence_refs.target_language='Vietnamese'`
   and proper diacritics. Required an orphan-context fix
   (`05c6e67`) — `loadOfferingContext` was returning null for partners
   with no project/product link, killing the localisation pipeline.
2. **Teams smoke test — BLOCKED on operator accept click.** Invitation
   row created (`mcmdennis@gmail.com` invited to `61d43eaf` by
   `dennis@factory2key.com.au`). Branded "InvestorPilot" email from
   `noreply@updates.corporateaisolutions.com` sent successfully (the
   bare-domain `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` was silently rejecting before — now
   fixed). Operator signed in as mcmdennis but did NOT click the green
   "Accept and join" button. To resume, open this URL signed in as
   mcmdennis (token valid until 2026-05-25):
   `https://investor-pilot-pi.vercel.app/invite/accept?token=401be86cce7e6cbaec6940fef5dc38b2068fce6e57b3f8af`
   Click the green button → land at `/org/global-buildtech-australia-mnwnuyq6/dashboard` →
   switch back to dennis@factory2key.com.au and refresh /settings/team
   to confirm membership row + invite-gone-from-pending.
3. **Resend webhook configuration** — operator action: in Resend
   dashboard, add endpoint `https://investor-pilot-pi.vercel.app/api/webhooks/resend`,
   enable events (`email.bounced`, `email.complained`,
   `email.delivery_delayed`, `email.delivered`), copy signing secret
   into Vercel env `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for all envs. Now actually
   reachable since the middleware webhook allowlist shipped earlier.

## Bug-fix cascade from 2026-05-18 evening session

Bugs surfaced (most pre-existing, some introduced earlier the same day)
while verifying item 1 above. All fixed and pushed to `main`:

- `05c6e67` — orphan-localisation pass-through in `loadOfferingContext`
- `1ca4bb3` — `useSearchParams` Suspense boundary on /invite/accept
  (production deploys had been failing for ~1h since Lane D)
- `4b90971` — middleware allowlist for `/api/cron/*` (cron silently
  401-ing for days)
- `38d5aed` — Regenerate API + Approvals client carry
  target_language/outreach_tier/original_* so badge refreshes inline
- `24e80b5` — middleware no longer uses `next/cache`'s
  `unstable_cache` (not Edge-runtime compatible → MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED)
- `857d303` — middleware slug→id lookup uses authenticated supabase
  client (anon hit RLS, always returned null → "Org not found")
- `1d224a3` — settings page + 5 settings routes migrated off the
  ambiguous `organisations(*)` relational shorthand and off legacy
  `profile.organisation_id` reads/writes

Vercel env-var corrections in same session: `CRON_SECRET` was stored
as empty `""` (re-set to real value); `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` was on the
bare domain `corporateaisolutions.com` which is NOT Resend-verified
(re-set to `noreply@updates.corporateaisolutions.com`).

## Multi-org legacy column audit pending

53 files still read `profile.organisation_id` (legacy column) instead
of `active_organisation_id`. Latent — symptom only emerges when a
user switches between orgs (currently every user has
`active_organisation_id = organisation_id`, so no divergence). Settings
surface is migrated; the rest is opportunistic ("if you touch the file
for any reason, migrate it as part of the change"). See
`~/.claude/projects/.../memory/project_multi_org_legacy_column_audit.md`.

## Priority for next session

1. **Product-side vocabulary fix — "buyers" not "investors"** — ~30 min.
   Products target BUYERS (or channel partners), not investors. UI copy
   currently leaks "investors" all over the Products page. Renderer
   prompts are already correct (`recipientNoun = 'partner'` when
   `offering_kind === 'product'`) so this is pure UI/comment cleanup.
   Scope:
   - `src/app/(dashboard)/org/[slug]/products/page.tsx` — 8 spots (lines
     267, 296, 634, 636, 645, 696, **704** ("Find investors for this product"
     — the visible one operator flagged), 746, 760). Rename function
     `findInvestorsForProduct` → `findBuyersForProduct` (or
     `findPartnersForProduct` — decide canonical noun).
   - `src/app/api/pipeline/discover-batch/route.ts:4` — header comment
     "The Find investors for this product engine."
   - Also audit any related copy: button "Find Investors" → "Find Buyers"
     / "Find Partners"; rubric-required banner; any e-mail bodies that
     leak the wrong audience term.
   - Decision needed first: canonical noun. Options are buyer / partner /
     channel partner / customer. Renderer uses `partner` already.
2. **Bounce → re-enrich auto-flow** — quarter-day
3. **Operator-configurable compliance ruleset** — half-day
4. **Global pause flag** (org-level) — 2-3 hours
5. **Teams follow-ups** (if usage surfaces friction):
   - /approvals UI surface for steps stuck on disconnected channels
   - Channels filter "show only mine" (today shows all org channels)
   - Step reassignment without waiting for channel reconnect
